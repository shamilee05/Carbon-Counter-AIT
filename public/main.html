        <h3> About Carbon Counter </h3>
        <p>
            With an ever-increasing population and the consequent strain put on various resources, 
            it becomes important to be aware of what and how much we consume as individuals and furthermore, 
            how we can reduce our consumption so as to contribute to a healthier environment.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In present times, when not everyone is equally interested in contributing their part to the environment, 
            Carbon Counter makes sure that the user keeps their consumption levels in check by carefully calculating 
            the amount of CO2 levels emitted due to the various daily activities that they perform - 
            commuting via their car to reach their workplace, using the kettle to get their morning coffee, 
            using the hairdryer, etc. Increasing levels of CO2 is, definitely, 
            a growing problem and this is one way wherein people could acknowledge their consumption rates and 
            take efforts to minimize them, hence doing their bit for the environment.

        <h3> Activities </h3>
        <p>
            After logging in with us, you can start recording all your activities for the day. 
            This can start from as early as your morning bath wherein you could tell us the amount of time you used 
            the geyser for or you could us about your commute to work and hence how much fuel your car/motorcycle consumed on the way.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As of now, we have three sections, Vehicular Travelling, Domestic Activities and Work Activities. On choosing 
            each of these you get the following options under every activity: under Vehicular Travelling we have 'using the car' or 
            'using a motorcycle', under Domestic Activities we have 'using the geyser' or 'using the kettle' and finally under 
            Work Activities we have 'using the laptop' or 'using the printer'. Hence on choosing an option out of these, 
            you would be asked the duration that you performed the activity for and our algorithms will work out the 
            amount of carbon that was emitted in this process. We will also make up a dashboard for you which you can keep checking 
            to see your progress and if your emissions have decreased.
